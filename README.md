Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - The site does not list when the 2020 elections are taking place.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration and absentee in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - The navbar-brand link won't work beyond your laptop due to the way you wrote the href.
    - Arguably the "Who Are We" section is not for navigation and thus shouldn't be a nav.
    - Several pages contain sections that are marked up as paragraphs but really ought to be lists.
    - The "How to Vote" and "Absentee Voting" pages are lengthy and could use a bit more internal structure.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - There is no active-link highlighting in the navbar, so visitors can't keep track of where they are.
    - Lists on the "How to Vote" and "Absentee Voting" pages don't have a consistent appearance.
